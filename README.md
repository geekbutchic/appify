 # Node Immersives

Welcome to making your first terminal app!

### A Refresher

* You will NOT be returning anything or writing any functions. All your code will run in the global scope, from top to bottom, as soon as you run it!
* You will run your app using the command `node nodeimmersives.js`. (Or the path to that file if you're not in this directory.)
* You will take in TWO arguments from the user: their first name and their last name, separated by a space. So you'll run your app with `node nodeimmersives.js Colin Jaffe`, or whatever name you'd like to call it with.
* In your JavaScript file, that will come in as `process.argv[2]` and `process.argv[3]`. It's probably a good idea to save them in variables!
* Then you will print out each of the solutions to the task using `console.log`, and they should appear in the terminal as soon as you run the app!
* That is (currently) the only tool we have for verifying your app works. Manual testing, ladies and gentlemen! It's... great?


### Your Tasks, in Roughly Ascending Order of Difficulty

1. Say hi to the user in whatever style you want, with their full name. Remember that you'll have to combine the two arguments to make the full name!
2. Give them their name capitalized, preferably with some kind of sentence around it telling them what you're doing.
3. Print out their initials. (Again, telling them what you're doing!).
4. Give them their codeimmersives.com email address. For example, given `Colin Jaffe`, you should print out for them `colin.jaffe@codeimmersives.com`.


### Good Luck!

And may the node be with you?
